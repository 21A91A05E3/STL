csp - cloud service provider
ex:  google cloud,aws cloud,azure,oracle,ibm,alibaba,digital ocean,rackspace

isp - internet service provider

computer resources - ram and cpu

acess : 1) student 2)root

cloud is a rented service

Server -- gives the hosted service to the clients.

Cloud Characteristics according to NIST: 

NIST : National Institute of Standards and Technology --> US based company

1.On Demand Self Service
2.Broad Network Acess
3.Elasticity
4.Resource Pooling
5.Metered Services

1.On Demand Self Service:

server requested ->system admin (approves the request) -->accounts ->released ->order ->deliver -->connect to server room -->install os -->connect to network ->use the server  
The above process is creation of physical server which takes nearly 20 days.

But if we use cloud we can get the required server within few minutes.


2.Broad Network Acess: 
		Accessing the server at one location in another location.

3.Elasticity:
	Expanding and releasing of memory
			 (or)
	Increasing and decreasing the resources instantly.

4.Resource Pooling:  (cloud prespective) 
	Massive resources like ram,server,memory.Large quantity of resources are avaible everytime.

5.Metered Services: "Pay as you go"
	The amount to be paid depends on how long and how much you used the resource
